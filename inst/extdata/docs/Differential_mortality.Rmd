# Introduction

One of the commonest criticisms of media reporting on the pandemic has been the use of a cumulative death count as a measure of progress of the disease.  This has led to the public perception of ever increasing mortality. The number has been used without a reference denominator. At the very least the number of deaths that would be expected to occur naturally over any given period should have been included. 

In the highly charged political atmosphere of the United States the raw death toll has been particularly unhelpful as a metric. There has been a tendency to use the raw number as a yardstick to measure the performance of state governors.  One difficulty with this that has been widely overlooked is that the baseline mortality differs greatly between individual states.
